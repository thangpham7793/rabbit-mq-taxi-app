Even those already familiar with microservices and messaging will discover value in reading this book for an exploration of moving forward with best practices and resource efficiency. This book will give you the push you need to get started with creating new and exciting applications or migrating existing monoliths to a microservice architecture.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-7).

Code repository containing examples from the book Rabbit MQ Essentials Second Edition. Code is available from the folder
corresponding to the chapter name. This repository includes tests and further documentation.

RabbitMQ can be set up on your own machine, which is described in the book. Another option is to skip the hassle of the installation and configuration and use a hosted RabbitMQ solution. CloudAMQP is the largest provider of hosted RabbitMQ clusters, and free setups are availbale at: www.cloudamqp.com.

The book also uses the docker setup similar to that defined in the Docker compose file. You shuold
review the file before running docker-compose up. There are default usernames and passwords in this file used to
connect to the broker. You should change these defaults as they are easy to guess if testing in an insecure space.

We also provide a PDF file that has color images of the screenshots/diagrams used in this book. [Click here to download it](https://static.packt-cdn.com/downloads/9781789131666_ColorImages.pdf).
